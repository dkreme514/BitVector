Bit Vector project COP3330

Description: Show an array of bits for a given word    
  size. Have an array of bits of a certain word size.  
  With allocated word size of 32 bits, the driver program 
  implements the Sieve of Eratosthones to calculate all prime 
  numbers to 1000. 
  This project was to practice with vectors and simulate
  how bits work in a hardware setting, using a mask and offset 
  on words to find a given bit.
